# Catalyst Tracker

A free, self-hosted dashboard for **Indian insider-trading disclosures and corporate
actions**, built from BSE & NSE exports. It replaces a manual Excel + Power Query
workflow: drop in the exchange CSVs, run one command, and get a filterable dashboard
with charts, signal panels, and CSV export — deployable as a static site on GitHub Pages.

> Data is informational only and **not investment advice**.

## What it does

- **Insider Trading** (BSE primary, NSE secondary) — net buyers/sellers in ₹cr, per-company
  acquisition/disposal/pledge totals, daily buy-vs-sell, category breakdown, and your full
  Excel views, plus:
  - **Signal filters** — *Market trades only* (strips ESOP/gift/inter-se noise), *Promoters only*,
    and **cluster buying** detection (multiple distinct insiders buying the same company).
  - **Pledge activity** — shares pledged vs released per company.
  - **Insider × Corporate Action** cross-reference — companies appearing in both feeds.
  - **Auto value-sanitization** — repairs placeholder values (e.g. 696,000 shares "worth ₹3")
    from a matching twin row, or flags & excludes them so rankings stay clean.
  - **Data-quality & coverage panel** — exactly what was merged, repaired, flagged, and how fresh
    each source is.
- **Corporate Actions** — dividends, bonus, splits, rights, buybacks, mergers/demergers,
  REIT/InvIT distributions, with an ex-date/record-date calendar.
- **Open Offers** and **Preferential Issues** — scaffolded tabs, ready to populate (see below).
- Watchlist (saved in your browser), shareable deep-links, and CSV export on every table.

## How the data flows

```
data/raw/**/*.csv  ──►  python3 pipeline/ingest.py  ──►  docs/data/*.json  ──►  docs/ (static site)
   (you drop here)         normalize → sanitize →            (committed)         (GitHub Pages)
                           dedup → cross-feed merge
```

All processing is **standard-library Python** (no dependencies). The browser loads the generated
JSON and does all filtering/aggregation client-side.

### Updating the data

1. Download fresh exports:
   - BSE insider: <https://www.bseindia.com/corporates/insider_trading_new>
   - NSE insider: <https://www.nseindia.com/companies-listing/corporate-filings-insider-trading>
   - BSE corporate actions: <https://www.bseindia.com/corporates/corporate_act>
2. Put them in the matching folder (filenames don't matter; all CSVs in a folder are read):
   - `data/raw/insider/bse/`
   - `data/raw/insider/nse/`
   - `data/raw/corporate_actions/bse/`
3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./update.sh
   ```
   This re-ingests, runs the tests, commits, and (once GitHub is connected) pushes so the live
   site redeploys.

## Run / preview locally

```bash
python3 pipeline/ingest.py          # regenerate docs/data/*.json
python3 -m http.server -d docs 8000 # serve the site
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 tests/run_tests.py          # zero-dependency runner
# or: pytest                        # if you have it installed
```
Tests run against the real sample CSVs in `data/raw/` and assert the known behaviour
(dedup counts, cross-feed matches, placeholder handling, full vocabulary coverage).

## Connecting to GitHub & going live (first time)

You only do this **once**. It needs a free GitHub account.

1. **Log in to GitHub from your terminal** (interactive, opens a browser):
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   Choose: **GitHub.com → HTTPS → Login with a web browser**, then paste the code shown.
2. **Create the repo and push** (run from this folder):
   ```bash
   gh repo create catalyst-tracker --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```
3. **Turn on GitHub Pages** to serve the `docs/` folder:
   ```bash
   gh api -X POST repos/:owner/catalyst-tracker/pages -f source.branch=main -f source.path=/docs
   ```
   (Or in the browser: repo **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` / `/docs`**.)
4. Your site appears at `https://<your-username>.github.io/catalyst-tracker/` within a minute or two.

After this, every `./update.sh` pushes new data and the site redeploys automatically.

> **Git in one line:** Git tracks snapshots ("commits") of your files locally; GitHub is the
> cloud copy ("remote", named `origin`) that also hosts the website. `update.sh` handles
> committing and pushing for you.

## Adding Open Offers / Preferential Issues

These tabs are scaffolded and wired to empty data. To populate one:
1. Drop an export into `data/raw/open_offers/` or `data/raw/preferential/`.
2. Add a parser in `pipeline/parsers/` (mirror `bse_corpactions.py`) mapping its columns to a
   record dict, and emit it to `docs/data/<name>.json` from `pipeline/ingest.py`.
3. The shared filter/table/chart framework renders it automatically.

## Project layout

```
data/raw/            raw exchange CSVs (the canonical inputs, committed)
pipeline/            ingestion: normalize, parsers/, match, sanitize, aggregate, ingest
tests/               stdlib test suite + runner
docs/                the static site GitHub Pages serves
  data/              generated JSON (committed)
  js/ css/ lib/      app modules, styles, vendored Chart.js
update.sh            re-ingest + test + commit + push
PLAN.md              the design decisions behind this build
```

## Data notes & caveats

- **BSE is primary**; ~69% of NSE rows in the sample restate a BSE disclosure and are merged
  (NSE's XBRL link, Regulation, and broadcast time are folded into the BSE row).
- Matching is on normalized **company + person + transaction date + share count**. An ISIN map
  could improve this later but isn't required.
- Exchange exports aren't always cleanly date-bounded (some BSE rows date back years; NSE can lag
  its filename by weeks) — the **freshness panel** shows the dates actually present, so trust that
  over the filename.
